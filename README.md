ESP32 based VW TP2.0 Datalogger
====================

This is a port of [JacekGreniger's stm32-vagcanlogger](https://github.com/JacekGreniger/stm32-vagcanlogger) to the esp32. I have largely stripped the feature set down to only support TP2.0, as I have no use for K-Line diagnostics.

I am using a [CAN32](https://www.tindie.com/products/fusion/can32-an-esp32-dev-board-with-can-bus-v21/) for my implementation.
